# MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACHES-FOR-IMMUNE-SYSTEM-ANALYSIS-AND-MODELING
AI revolutionizes HIV detection with cutting-edge MLâ€”XGBoost, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more. Preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and SHAP values boost accuracy and interpretability, paving the way for smarter, reliable diagnostics.


The rapidly changing healthcare landscape has enhanced the facilitation of HIV
detection through artificial intelligence even more. This breakthrough is immense. Our
results, based on sophisticated machine learning techniques, indicate the paramount
importance of AI for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. CD4 and CD8 were a data set justifying
the testing of validity in different realms using different algorithms: XGBoost, K-Nearest
Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, and on top of that, Logistic Regression.
This was followed by advanced stages of pre-processing and the conceptualization of the
algorithms. Tremendous gains in these matrices with proper hyper-parameter tuning under
the purview of making each one sound and optimal have been realized. More specifically, the
models developed consider Gradient Boosting and LightGBM models, with achievements
where the testing accuracies are 86.68% and 86.21%, respectively, with the slightest
difference between the training and cross-validation accuracies. Explainable AI
interpretations by SHAP values tend to help in significant features of CD4 and CD8, thus
beefing interpretability and reliability. Besides that, all other results obtained from the
performance metrics have shown that the separation of classes of models has been done with
significant values of AUC. Such results underscore the need for further fine-tuning and
validation of this tool to ensure its robustness for practical purposes. We contribute to this
growing research by using machine-learning models to identify HIV. Specifically, the
reasons for touting the relevance of this paper were because we have done careful validation
of model performance and the need for intelligent features.
